# Ian Draves Web Page

**iandraves.github.io** is a fully open-source web page that contains all of my projects for easy access and, in the future, documentation for libraries that I may create. Most of the projects found on this page will be coded in Javascript or Python for anyone interested in editing them. All of the projects on this webpage can also be found on my Github page.
